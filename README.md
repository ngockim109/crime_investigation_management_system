## üåü Features

- **User Roles:** Differentiated access for various users, such as patrol officers, review officers, investigators, chief officers, forensic specialists, financial analysts and potentially public users for complaint lodging.
- **Case Management:**
  - Record and track new cases, including incident details, victims, and involved parties.
  - Update case statuses (e.g., new, processing, pending, done).
  - Assign cases to specific investigators or departments.
- **Criminal Records:**
  - Maintain a comprehensive database of criminals, including their profiles, past activities, and associations.
  - Search and retrieve criminal records efficiently.
- **Evidence Management:**
  - Store and organize digital evidence (e.g., images, documents, reports) related to cases.
  - Maintain the chain of custody for evidence.
- **Physical Evidences Management:**
  _ **Unique Identification:** Each physical evidence item receives a unique `identification_code`.
  _ **Detailed Collection Information:** Record precise details about the evidence's collection, including:
  _ `scene_location`: Where the evidence was found.
  _ `collected_time`: The exact time of collection.
  _ `scene_description`: A narrative of the scene and context of collection.
  _ `initial_condition`: The state of the evidence when initially found.
  _ `preservation_measures`: Actions taken to preserve the evidence.
  _ **Chain of Custody Tracking:** Link evidence to the `collector_username` (the officer who collected it) and the `case_id` it belongs to, ensuring a clear chain of custody.
  _ **Soft Deletion:** Physical evidence records can be marked as `is_deleted` for data retention and auditing purposes.
  _ **Automated Timestamps:** `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps are automatically managed.
- **Report Management:**
  - **Comprehensive Report Submission:** Users can submit detailed incident reports including:
    - **Crime Type:** Categorize reports by `against-persons`, `against-property`, `white-collar`, `cyber-crime`, `drug-related`, or `public-order`.
    - **Severity:** Mark reports as `urgent` or `not-urgent`.
    - **Time and Location:** Record the exact time and address of occurrence, along with the `case_location`.
    - **Detailed Description:** Provide a narrative of the incident.
    - **Reporter Information:** Capture reporter's full name, email, and phone number.
    - **Suspect Details:** Optionally include suspect's full name, physical description, contact information, and means of transport.
    - **Relation to Incident:** Specify if the reporter is a `victim`, `witness`, `offender`, or `anonymous`.
  - **Report Lifecycle:** Manage reports through distinct stages:
    - `PENDING`: Newly submitted reports awaiting review.
    - `APPROVED`: Reports accepted and potentially linked to a case.
    - `REJECTED`: Reports that are not processed further.
  - **Officer Approval:** Track the `officer_approve_id` for reports that have been approved or rejected by a specific officer.
  - **Automated Timestamps:** `reported_at`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` timestamps are automatically managed.
  - **Soft Deletion:** Reports can be marked as `is_deleted` instead of being permanently removed, allowing for data retention.
  - **Integration with Cases, Parties, and Evidences:** Reports are directly linked to `Case` entities upon approval, and can have multiple `Party` and `Evidence` entries associated with them.
- **Search Functionality:** Efficiently search for reports, physical evidences, cases, criminals, and other relevant information.
- **Secure Data Handling:** Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive crime data.
